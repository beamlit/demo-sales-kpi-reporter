This repository is a demo implementation of a Sales KPI Reporter agent built using the [Blaxel SDK](https://blaxel.ai) and [LangChain](https://langchain.com).
The agent processes HTTP requests, streams responses, and dynamically enriches conversational context with data stored in:

- an AWS S3 bucket
- a Qdrant-based knowledge base

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Interactive conversational interface for sales data analysis
- Integration with AWS S3 for storage of sales data
- Qdrant vector database for efficient knowledge retrieval
- Real-time streaming responses
- Built on LangChain for efficient agent orchestration
- Easy deployment and integration with Blaxel platform

## üöÄ Quick Start

For those who want to get up and running quickly:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/blaxel-ai/template-sales-kpi-reporter.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd template-sales-kpi-reporter

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment variables
cp .env-sample .env
# Edit .env with your credentials

# Register Blaxel components
bl apply -R -f .blaxel

# Start the server
bl serve --hotreload

# In another terminal, test the agent
bl chat template-sales-kpi-reporter
```

## üîå Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** v18 or later
- **Blaxel CLI:** Install globally:
  ```bash
  curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blaxel-ai/toolkit/main/install.sh | BINDIR=$HOME/.local/bin sh
  ```
- **Blaxel login:** Login to Blaxel platform
  ```bash
  bl login YOUR-WORKSPACE
  ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

**Clone the repository and install the dependencies**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blaxel-ai/template-sales-kpi-reporter.git
cd template-sales-kpi-reporter
npm install
```

**Environment Variables:** Create a `.env` file with your configuration. You can begin by copying the sample file:

```bash
cp .env-sample .env
```

Then, update the following values with your own credentials. If you do not have a `COLLECTION_NAME` on Qdrant already, you can run the pre-populating command in the next section to create a new collection:

- [AWS S3 credentials](https://aws.amazon.com/s3): `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_BUCKET`
- [Qdrant details](https://cloud.qdrant.io/accounts/d416c5c1-67f2-4e25-9f02-84205b220ab8/cloud-access/database-api-keys): `QDRANT_URL`, `QDRANT_API_KEY`, `QDRANT_COLLECTION_NAME` If you do not have a collection on Qdrant already, enter any collection_name and the collection will be created for you when running the pre-populating command in the next section.
- [OpenAI key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys): `OPENAI_API_KEY`

**Blaxel apply:** register your integration connection / functions / models on blaxel.ai

```bash
bl apply -R -f .blaxel
```

## üîß Usage

### (Optional) Populating the Knowledge Base

To populate the Qdrant knowledge base with documents:

1. Place your documents in the `documents` folder. If you do not have any documents, you can use the sample documents provided in the `documents` folder.
2. Run the following command to import the documents:
   ```bash
   npm run fill-knowledge-base
   ```

### Running the Server Locally

Start the development server with hot reloading using the Blaxel CLI command:

```bash
bl serve --hotreload
```

_Note:_ This command starts the server and enables hot reload so that changes to the source code are automatically reflected.

### Test your agent

Use Blaxel CLI to test your agent:

```bash
bl chat template-sales-kpi-reporter
```

Example questions to try:

- How can I boost Amazon listings?
- List my KPI on amazon sales
- How can I improve my sales? List countries where my KPI should improve. Do this list in a table

### Deploying to Blaxel

When you are ready to deploy your application, run:

```bash
bl deploy
```

This command uses your code and the configuration files under the `.blaxel` directory to deploy your application.

## üìñ API Reference

The Sales KPI Reporter agent exposes the following endpoints:

- **POST /agents/{agent_id}/run**: Run the agent with provided input
  ```json
  {
    "input": "List my KPI on amazon sales",
    "stream": true
  }
  ```

- **GET /agents/{agent_id}/info**: Get information about the agent capabilities
- **GET /health**: Health check endpoint

For detailed API documentation, run the server and visit `/docs` endpoint.

## üìù Examples

### Basic KPI Query

```
User: List my KPI on amazon sales
Agent: Here are your current Amazon sales KPIs:

| Metric | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total Revenue | $1,245,689 | ‚ñ≤ 12% |
| Average Order Value | $42.37 | ‚ñº 3% |
| Conversion Rate | 4.2% | ‚ñ≤ 0.5% |
| Return Rate | 8.7% | ‚ñº 1.2% |
| Customer Satisfaction | 4.3/5 | ‚ñ≤ 0.2 |
| Inventory Turnover | 7.8x | ‚ñ≤ 0.6x |

Your strongest markets are:
1. United States (47% of sales)
2. United Kingdom (18% of sales)
3. Germany (12% of sales)

Would you like me to provide more detailed analysis on any particular metric?
```

### Sales Improvement Query

```
User: How can I improve my sales in Europe?
Agent: Based on your current KPIs for European markets, here are targeted improvement opportunities:

1. **Germany (12% of sales)**
   - Improve product listing translations (current score: 82%)
   - Expand selection in high-performance categories (home goods, electronics)
   - Increase sponsored product ad budget by 15-20%

2. **France (8% of sales)**
   - Address higher-than-average return rates (currently 11.2%)
